======

NIMBLE is an online Labelling Information System owned by Vegware UK for the purpose of providing Vegware Customers across the UK
and Ireland with a completely user-friendly approach to creating/customizing and printing out product labels for completely 
compostable, eco-friendly, food packaging products. Its entirely based upon HTML5, CSS3, JAVASCRIPT, PHP & MYSQL. It is
essentially an AJAX-enabled web application that is on its own available at http://www.nimble-label.co.uk/. 

This application has also come complete with Back-office and Resellers/Distributor Web-based sub-systems that work interconnectedly
with the main website and are based on entirely the same technologies. Its a fairly large-scale application and is even currently
still under development. It is expected to have been fully developed by December 2015, but has already gone into production.
